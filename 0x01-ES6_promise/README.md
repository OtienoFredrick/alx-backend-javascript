# 0x01. ES6 Promises

## Overview
This project focuses on understanding and implementing ES6 Promises in JavaScript. Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations, allowing developers to write cleaner, more manageable code without falling into callback hell. This repository contains a series of tasks aimed at improving your understanding of how promises work in JavaScript.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Understand how promises work and their use cases.
- Implement promises to handle asynchronous operations.
- Chain promises together using `.then()` and `.catch()`.
- Use `Promise.all()` and `Promise.race()` to manage multiple promises.
- Handle errors gracefully in promise-based workflows.

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:
