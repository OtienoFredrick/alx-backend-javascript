0x03. ES6 Data Manipulation
Project Overview
The 0x03. ES6 Data Manipulation project is designed to deepen your understanding of data manipulation techniques in JavaScript using ES6 features. This project emphasizes the use of modern JavaScript functionalities to manage and manipulate data efficiently.

Key Concepts
Array Methods: You will learn how to effectively use methods like map, filter, and reduce to perform operations on arrays, enabling you to transform and extract data with ease.

Data Structures: The project will introduce you to various data structures such as:

Sets: Used to store unique values of any type.
Maps: A collection of key-value pairs that allows you to associate values with unique keys.
WeakMaps: Similar to Maps but with keys that are garbage-collected if there are no other references to the key.
Typed Arrays: Gain insights into typed arrays, which provide a mechanism to read and write binary data in a more efficient way compared to regular arrays.

Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you will be able to:

Explain the differences and appropriate use cases for map, filter, and reduce on arrays.
Demonstrate proficiency in using Set, Map, and WeakMap data structures.
Understand and utilize typed arrays for handling binary data in JavaScript.
