ES6 Classes and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Project
Project Overview
This project is centered on using ES6 classes and applying Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in JavaScript. It includes tasks that focus on understanding class syntax, inheritance, static methods, and advanced concepts like metaprogramming. The goal is to deepen your understanding of OOP in JavaScript by leveraging ES6 features.

Key Concepts
1. Defining a Class
Learn how to define classes using the ES6 class keyword.
Understand how classes act as blueprints for creating objects with predefined properties and methods.
2. Methods in Classes
Learn how to add methods directly to a class.
Explore how instance methods operate on individual objects of a class.
3. Static Methods
Understand what static methods are and how to define them.
Learn the use cases of static methods, which are called on the class itself rather than on instances.
4. Class Inheritance
Learn how to extend a class from another using the extends keyword.
Understand how inheritance works, allowing classes to share behavior while adding specialized functionality.
5. Metaprogramming and Symbols
Delve into advanced metaprogramming techniques in JavaScript, such as using symbols and proxy objects.
Understand how metaprogramming allows you to modify and extend the behavior of classes dynamically.
Requirements
Execution Environment: The project should be developed and tested on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using NodeJS 12.11.x.
Editors: vi, vim, emacs, or Visual Studio Code can be used to write your code.
File Format: Your code should use the .js extension and adhere to proper formatting with a new line at the end of each file.
Testing: All code will be tested using Jest. You can run tests with the command npm run test.
Linting: Code quality will be checked using ESLint. Ensure your code passes linting with npm run lint.
Full Project Check: Verify that your project passes both tests and lint checks using the command npm run full-test.
How to Run the Project
Clone the repository.
Install the necessary dependencies with npm install.
To run tests, use npm run test.
For linting, use npm run lint.
Run the complete suite of tests and lint checks with npm run full-test.
